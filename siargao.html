        <h2>About Siargao</h2>
        <p>Siargao Island in the Mindanao region has attracted surfers from across the globe thanks to the constant waves along its coast. While it's earned the nickname of the "Surfing Capital of the Philippines," the island has more to offer outside of riding the waves. 

        For a more relaxed time, it's highly recommended to go island-hopping to visit the best Siargao beaches. The first stop in Siargao island hopping tours is Naked Island, which features a bare stretch of powdery white sand beach perfect for sunbathing. Another part of the famous trio of islands here is Guyam Island.</p>
